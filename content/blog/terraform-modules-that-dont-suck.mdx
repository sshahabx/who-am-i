# Writing Terraform Modules That Don't Suck

If you've ever worked with Terraform at scale, you know that modules can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. After building infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP for the past few years, I've learned some hard lessons about what makes a good module.

## The Problem with Most Terraform Modules

Most Terraform modules fall into one of two categories:

1. **Too specific** - They solve exactly one problem for one use case and can't be reused
2. **Too generic** - They try to support every possible configuration and become impossible to maintain

The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, and finding it requires careful thought about abstractions.

## Principles for Good Modules

### 1. Start with the Interface

Before writing any code, think about how you want to use the module. What would the ideal API look like?

```hcl
module "app_cluster" {
  source = "./modules/kubernetes-cluster"
  
  environment = "production"
  region      = "us-west-2"
  
  node_pools = {
    general = {
      instance_type = "t3.large"
      min_size      = 3
      max_size      = 10
    }
  }
}
```

Clean, readable, and focused on *what* you want, not *how* it's implemented.

### 2. Use Sensible Defaults

Don't make users configure everything. Provide defaults that work for 80% of use cases.

```hcl
variable "node_pools" {
  type = map(object({
    instance_type = string
    min_size      = optional(number, 2)
    max_size      = optional(number, 5)
    disk_size     = optional(number, 100)
  }))
}
```

Notice the `optional()` function - it's a game changer for module design.

### 3. Validate Input Early

Use validation blocks to catch errors before they hit the provider:

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  type = string
  
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "production"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be dev, staging, or production."
  }
}
```

This saves debugging time and makes the module self-documenting.

## Real-World Example

Here's a simplified version of a module I use for creating EKS clusters:

```hcl
module "eks_cluster" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  
  cluster_name    = "\${var.environment}-\${var.project_name}"
  cluster_version = "1.28"
  
  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets
  
  eks_managed_node_groups = {
    for pool_name, pool_config in var.node_pools : pool_name => {
      instance_types = [pool_config.instance_type]
      min_size       = pool_config.min_size
      max_size       = pool_config.max_size
      desired_size   = pool_config.min_size
      
      labels = {
        Environment = var.environment
        NodePool    = pool_name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Modules

Don't skip testing. Use `terraform-compliance` or write tests with Terratest. Your future self will thank you.

## Conclusion

Good Terraform modules are all about finding the right level of abstraction. They should:

- Have a clean, intuitive interface
- Provide sensible defaults
- Validate inputs early
- Be well-documented
- Be thoroughly tested

Remember: A module is a contract between you and your team. Make it a good one.
